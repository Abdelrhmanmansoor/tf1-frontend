# TF1 Sports Platform

## Overview

TF1 is a comprehensive sports networking platform designed for Egypt and the Middle East, conceptualized as a "LinkedIn for sports." Its primary goal is to connect various sports professionals, including players, coaches, clubs, and specialists (physiotherapists, nutritionists, fitness trainers, sports psychologists), to facilitate career growth and community building within the sports industry. The platform aims to offer a robust, bilingual, and multi-role online environment for sports professionals.

## User Preferences

- **Design**: Simple, elegant, minimal with blue-cyan-green gradients
- **Performance**: Lightweight, fast-loading pages
- **Language**: Arabic preferred, with English support
- **Direction**: RTL for Arabic, LTR for English

## System Architecture

The TF1 platform is a Next.js 15 web application utilizing the App Router. It uses TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Radix UI for accessible UI components. State is managed with Zustand, and data fetching with TanStack React Query v5 and Axios. Form handling employs React Hook Form with Zod validation. The application supports internationalization with `next-intl` for Arabic and English, including RTL layout. Theming is handled by `next-themes` for dark/light mode, real-time features use Socket.io, and animations are powered by Framer Motion.

**Key Features:**

-   **Multi-Role System**: Supports Players, Coaches, Clubs, Specialists, and various administrative roles (Administrator, Age Group Supervisor, Sports Director, Executive Director, Secretary). Each role has dedicated dashboards and profile management.
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with email verification and password reset.
-   **Profile Management**: Role-specific dashboards and profiles.
-   **Messaging**: Real-time chat functionality.
-   **Opportunities**: A job board for sports-related positions, integrated with a smart job notification system.

-   **Search**: Global search capabilities across users, clubs, and opportunities.
-   **Bilingual Support**: Full Arabic and English support with dynamic RTL/LTR layouts.
