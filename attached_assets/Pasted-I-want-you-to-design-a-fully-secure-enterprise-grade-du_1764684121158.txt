I want you to design a fully-secure, enterprise-grade, dual-dashboard management system for my platform. The system must contain two separate dashboards:

1) Leader Dashboard (Full Master Control)

This dashboard belongs to the “Leader Account”.
The Leader must have:

100% unlimited control over every part of the platform (front end + back end).

Full access to all modules, users, roles, permissions, logs, settings, content, categories, jobs, applications, marketing tools, analytics… absolutely everything.

Ability to create unlimited Team Accounts.

Ability to assign permissions individually to each team account (permission-by-permission).

Ability to generate a unique access key / code for each user for secure login tracking.

A complete audit trail showing (every login, every click, every update, every action).

A safe interface that guarantees no crashes, no 404 pages, and no broken routes.

If any page is missing or unavailable → the dashboard should never kick the Leader out. The system must redirect to a safe fallback page inside the dashboard with the user profile always accessible.

Every button, every section, every route must be fully connected and functional with guaranteed stability.

2) Team Dashboard

The Team dashboard is for assistant users.
Behaviour must follow:

The Team account only sees what the Leader enables.

The Leader grants permissions one-by-one (like major platforms: Facebook Business, Google Workspace, etc.).

If a team member attempts to enter a restricted section → the system must NOT log him out, but show a safe “Access Denied — return to dashboard” page inside the dashboard.

Every active module must be 100% functional with no broken links or errors.

All buttons, features, tables, lists, and forms must be fully interactive and stable.

3) Roles System

Remove the role named “إداري” because it was incorrectly implemented as a system controller.

Replace it with:
“Administrative Officer — Sports Field”
This is a job role, not a system management role.

The system must not treat this role as an admin or give any platform-level control.

4) Stability Requirements

The platform must:

Prevent any accidental logout due to clicking a wrong button.

Never throw 404 pages, incorrect redirects, or empty screens.

Always redirect safely inside the dashboard with a valid navigation menu.

Validate all routes, permissions, UI states, and components.

Guarantee that every single button works correctly, including:

Category Manager

Job Manager

Applicants

Settings

Profile

Notifications

Logs

Any section added now or in the future

If a route fails → automatic fallback inside the dashboard (never outside).

5) Security & Verification

The system must include:

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Permission-by-permission assignment

Unique login keys per user

Full logging and tracking

No route exposure

Safe redirects

Full protection against broken pages

Consistency testing to verify that every part of both dashboards is active and functioning

6) Final Deliverables

Generate a full technical blueprint including:

Architecture

Database structure

Roles and permissions map

Navigation map

Safe redirect mechanics

Fallback pages

State management strategy

Error-free routing structure

Verification checklist ensuring that every section, every button, and every route is 100% functional for both dashboards.

The solution must guarantee absolute stability, no errors, no broken paths, and no logout issues, with a strict hierarchical control system where the Leader has full authority over everything.
