The Executive Director Dashboard (“المدير التنفيذي”) is currently incomplete and several modules appear visually correct but are not connected to real backend logic. I need you to rebuild, validate, and fully activate every part of this role without exceptions.

1) Major Issue

The Executive Director dashboard contains:

Static numbers

Non-interactive KPI blocks

Placeholder strategic initiatives

Buttons with no actions behind them

Modules existing only on UI without logic

This is unacceptable.
The Executive Director must see real, dynamic, fully connected strategic data.

2) Required Functional Modules
A) KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

EVERYTHING must be pulled from real database logic:

Member satisfaction

Revenue growth

Employee retention

Programs completion rate

Compared against goals

Clicking any KPI must open a full detailed report.

B) Strategic Initiatives

Every initiative must be real and editable:

Title

Type (Planning – Execution – Completed)

Progress % from backend

Deadline

Assigned department

Tasks inside each initiative

User must be able to:

Add new initiative

Edit progress

Change status

ZERO dummy items are allowed.

C) Announcements & Partnerships

Both modules must be:

Fully functional

Dynamic

Connected to backend tables

Without broken routes

Clicking an item must lead to a fully working details page.

3) Mandatory Stability Requirements

No broken pages

No 404

No logout

Every card, list, button, icon, and page must be connected and functional

Dashboard must operate like a real enterprise system

All navigation must stay inside the dashboard

Every route must have fallback & error-proof flow

These points are non-negotiable.

4) New Strict Requirement (Non-Negotiable Rule)
Every role in the entire platform MUST contain a “Job Notifications Module”, and this module must operate with a real smart automated job-matching system, not a decorative design.

This system must work exactly as follows:

A) When any club/organization posts a job:

The system automatically detects suitable users based on:

Role

Skills

Department

Tags from their profile

These users receive an instant job notification

Notification includes:

Job title

Job details

Club/organization name

Deadline

“Apply Now” button (opens real application form)

B) When a user applies to a job:

The club/organization receives an instant smart notification

Notification includes:

Applicant’s name

Role

CV link

Experience summary

Full view button

C) Job Notification Feed

Every dashboard role must include this feed:

Executive Director

Sports Director

Secretary

Coach

Admin

Any new roles added

This module must show:

New job postings

Applications received

Application status updates

Urgent jobs

Smart suggestions

D) System Intelligence (Required)

The system must:

Match users automatically to suitable jobs

Follow scoring rules

Learn from user history

Filter irrelevant notifications

Prevent duplicates

E) Notifications Delivery

Must use a real-time system (WebSocket / SSE / Firebase):

Badge count updates live

Notification bell updates live

All dashboards display notifications simultaneously

This requirement is strict and non-negotiable.
The Job Notification System must be fully functional, intelligent, real-time, and integrated for all roles with NO exceptions.

5) Final Deliverables

Deliver a full, working, error-proof Executive Director Dashboard with:

Real KPIs

Real strategic initiatives

Fully functional module navigation

Real data backend connection

Smart job notification engine

Zero dummy content

Zero broken links

Zero missing data

Zero static placeholders

And complete stability across all routes

Everything must be fully dynamic, real-data-driven, and enterprise-level. No placeholders. No static UI. No conceptual features. Everything must be implemented exactly as described.
