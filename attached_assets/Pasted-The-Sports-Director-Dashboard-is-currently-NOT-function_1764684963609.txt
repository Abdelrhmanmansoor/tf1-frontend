The “Sports Director Dashboard” is currently NOT functional and contains multiple sections that are visually designed but not connected to any real data. I need you to completely review, restructure, and rebuild this role to ensure every component is real, active, and fully functional.

1) Core Issue

Right now, the Sports Director is seeing:

Dummy numbers

Non-functional buttons

Visual UI that is not linked to the backend

Pages that open but do nothing

Some modules that should not exist

Some modules that exist but don’t work

This role must become fully production-ready, NO placeholders, NO static values, NO broken data.

2) Role Purpose

The Sports Director manages:

Coaches

Athletes

Training programs

Performance analytics

Upcoming events

Technical reports

Therefore the dashboard must reflect real actionable data, not decorative blocks.

3) Required Functional Modules
A) Coaches Performance

Real rating from real sessions

Clicking a coach must open a detailed view with:

Sessions count

Performance history

Attendance

Notes

Programs assigned

All buttons (messages – details – profile – actions) must work

B) Athletes

Live count

Filters by category / team / coach

Detailed profiles (performance – attendance – results)

C) Sports Programs

Add new program

Edit existing program

Show progress bars based on actual completion %, not random values

Ability to activate/inactivate programs

D) Technical Events

Upcoming events connected to real database dates

Ability to add/edit/remove events

E) Training Hours

Total hours from actual sessions

Calculated automatically

F) Achievements / Win Rate

Win % must be calculated from real matches

Ability to see details when clicking the card

4) Remove Fake Data

Everything shown in the UI must:

Come from the database

Be updated in real time

Not rely on hardcoded or placeholder values

The system must run a check to ensure zero dummy content across the entire Sports Director dashboard.

5) No Errors — No 404 — No Logout

The dashboard must:

Never kick Sports Director out when clicking a module

Never produce broken pages or missing routes

Always redirect safely inside the dashboard

Contain functional navigation for every element

6) Notification System (Recommended Architecture)

The Sports Director must receive:

Instant Notifications for:

New athlete added

Program updated

Coach performance changes

New match scheduled

New event

Urgent reports from coaches

Notification Center

Title

Category (program – coach – team – event)

Timestamp

Action button (open related module)

Use WebSocket / Firebase / Server Sent Events for real-time delivery.

7) Stability Check

Verify that EVERY:

Card

Counter

List

Button

Icon

Section

Progress bar

Routing

Data fetch

…is working and connected to real backend logic.

The Sports Director dashboard must behave like an enterprise system, not a static design.

Deliver a fully functional, real-data-driven, stable, error-free Sports Director Dashboard with no dummy content and full operational control for all sports-related modules.
