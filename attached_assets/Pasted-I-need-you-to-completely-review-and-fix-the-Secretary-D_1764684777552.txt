I need you to completely review and fix the “Secretary Dashboard” because currently nothing is functioning correctly inside this role.

The Secretary role must:

Have fully functional modules with no fake or placeholder data.

Every button, tab, icon, and list must be connected to real back-end data.

Remove all dummy data and ensure that every item displayed on the dashboard is generated from the actual database.

All pages must open without crashes, without redirecting outside the dashboard, without logging the user out, and without any 404 pages.

The Secretary role must show ONLY the modules assigned to it but each assigned module must be 100% active, not decorative.

Functional Requirements

Meetings

Ability to view today’s meetings

Add a new meeting

Edit meeting

Mark meeting as completed / important

Real-time update without manual refresh

Messages

Ability to view all messages (urgent / normal)

Filtering, searching, marking as read/unread

No fake messages

Documents

View all pending documents

Add new document

Edit/update status (approved — pending — rejected)

Tasks

Fully functional daily task list

Ability to mark tasks done / pending / in-progress

Calls log

Ability to add new call logs

View call history

All sections must be real, active, linked to the database, and fully interactive.

Fix the Role Definition

The secretary role must:

NOT have admin-level permissions

NOT manage platform settings

ONLY manage: documents, meetings, calls, messages, tasks

Everything in this role must be stable and functional exactly like enterprise-level dashboards

Notifications System (Proposed Mechanism)

Implement a unified real-time notifications system with the following logic:

Use a centralized notifications hub (WebSocket or Firebase-like system)

Each module triggers notifications automatically:

New message received → Secretary gets instant notification

New meeting assigned → Appears instantly

Document status update → Real-time alert

Task deadline approaching → Automatic reminder

Notifications must appear in:

Notification bell

Dashboard quick cards

In-page highlighting (like WhatsApp unread style)

Every notification must have:

Title

Description

Type (urgent / normal)

Timestamp

Action button (open the related page)

Quality & Stability Requirements

Absolutely no fake data

No decorative UI with no functionality

No broken routes

No logout redirects

No 404 pages

Every link, icon, and button must be fully active

Role must be validated end-to-end

The dashboard must behave exactly like a real production system

Deliver a fully functional, real-data-driven, stable, and error-free Secretary Dashboard.
